collecting consumed internet content for later use. a silly toy service.

## status

this codebase is meant to serve two purposes:

first, it should serve as a base for a few link aggregation/tracking ideas i want to solve for myself.
think something like readwise and matter, but i host it myself and i just build the features i plan to use.
for example, once i'm tracking read pieces in earnest and after i fill in the backlog, i hope to 
programmatically synthesize the links to my website. think something like readsomethingwonderful.com
(spectacular site also by matter), but for my reading diet and maybe with more organization.

second, it serves as a place where i can just mess around with things guilt-free.
i aim to keep the code nice, but higher-level decisions aren't particularly pragmatic.
